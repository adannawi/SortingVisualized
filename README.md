# SortingVisualized

Sorting Visualized is my attempt to learn C++ GUI creation using the Qt framework. The goal of the GUI is to simply visualize some popular sorting methods, and some inconventional methods as well, just to compare their performances. Still a work in progress.
Once I get the hang of Qt, I will likely redo this project in a multithreaded manner, just to allow the opportunity for more features such as audio cues to accompany the visualization.
